## Example

Here's a quick example to get you started:

1. **Input Text:**

    ```
    The process of photosynthesis is used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water.
    ```

2. **Generated Questions:**

    - **MCQ**: What is the process used by plants to convert light energy into chemical energy?
        - a) Respiration
        - b) Photosynthesis
        - c) Digestion
        - d) Fermentation

    - **Short Answer**: What are the molecules synthesized from carbon dioxide and water during photosynthesis?
    
    - **Descriptive**: Explain the process of photosynthesis and its significance to living organisms.
